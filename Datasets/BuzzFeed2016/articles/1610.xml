    <mainText>Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump held a “town hall style” meeting in Cleveland Heights with the alleged goal of discussing “African-American concerns,” strangely hosted by Sean Hannity via Fox News. The only problem: Hardly any African-Americans attended. Former Digital Director and Deputy Director for the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee Brandon English noted on social media today the noticeably white audience attending Trump’s event. In fact, there seemed to be more African Americans on stage behind Hannity than in the audience.

The literature said “When Christians don’t vote we lose our voice,” implying that the election’s results will decide “Whether or not Religious Liberty is protected.” As English noted, 42% Cleveland Heights is black, and yet well over 95% of the town hall’s attendees appeared to be white. This lends credence to the polls which predict a dismal African-American turnout for Trump, despite his claims to the contrary.

The central pitch to black Americans has repeatedly been “What do you have to lose?” If attendance at these events is any indication, perhaps they feel that a Trump vote could stand to lose them quite a bit.        </mainText>
