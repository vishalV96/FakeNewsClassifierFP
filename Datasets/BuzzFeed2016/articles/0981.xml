    <mainText>Lester Holt, "NBC Nightly News" anchor and moderator of the first presidential debate scheduled for next Monday announced the topics that will serve as a jumping off point for his questions. The topics include "America's Direction," "Achieving Prosperity" and "Securing America." The announcement came with a caveat that the topics could change due to news developments. The debate, which will be held at Hofstra University on Long Island, New York, will feature six 15-minute segments over a 90 minute period with no commercial breaks. Two of the 15-minute segments will focus on each of the announced topics.</mainText>
