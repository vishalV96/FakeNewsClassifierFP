    <mainText>Please disable your Ad Blocker in order to interact with the site. A key skill for ANY public speaker is the ability to handle a hostile audience. Hillary – sadly – does not appear to have learned this skill. Watch as she waits for the audience to come to her rescue:  She’s not very good at this at all. She missed a really good chance at a humanizing laugh line. Imagine the crowd response if she’d told the heckler to direct his comment to Bill? Too late. The moment is gone. Share if you think Hillary’s unfit to be President in EVERY possible way. </mainText>
