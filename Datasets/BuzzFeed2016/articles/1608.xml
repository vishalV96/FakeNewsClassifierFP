    <mainText>One brave police chief in Ohio is speaking out over the killing of Terence Crutcher by police in Tulsa, Oklahoma. In two tweets, Rodney Muterspaw — police chief of Middletown, Ohio, just outside of Cincinnati — sharply criticized his fellow police officers in response to the killing of 40-year-old father of four Terence Crutcher, who was killed shortly after his SUV broke down on the way home from a community college class. Without mentioning the officer by name, Muterspaw said officers who killed without exhausting all other options were “making [law enforcement] look bad.” As an officer I am so sick and drained of some cops doing things like this. You are making us all look bad. STOP. #TerenceCruthcher — R_Muterspaw (@RodneyMute) September 20, 2016  Muterspaw added that he was “sick of seeing death and hate” and implored his colleagues in law enforcement to embrace “compassion and empathy.” Life is precious man. Sorry we don't all agree. Compassion and empathy is eternally important. Just sick of seeing death &amp; hate. #Life — R_Muterspaw (@RodneyMute) September 20, 2016  The tweets garnered dozens of responses from Muterspaw’s followers, nearly all of whom gave the standard pro-police lines of argument often heard after the killing of a civilian by law enforcement. Muterspaw unflinchingly defended his words, saying he had been in similar situations before, and that the top priority was to “protect life first.” @godisgood1961 Been on that type of call/situation over 100x. You don't shoot for non-compliance. You shoot when UOF escalates. Not hard. — R_Muterspaw (@RodneyMute) September 20, 2016  @EASTBAYDFRESH @askarsismygod been in that situation 100x….communication, taser, pepper spray…whatever it takes to protect life first — R_Muterspaw (@RodneyMute) September 20, 2016  The killing of Terence Crutcher ignited outrage on social media after video of the shooting was released earlier this week. In the video, Crutcher is seen standing by his disabled vehicle with his hands up, while a slew of officers approach him with guns drawn. As Crutcher walks to his driver side window, the officers used tasers and opened fire, believing he was reaching for a weapon. However, no gun was found at the scene of Crutcher’s slaying. In the helicopter footage, an officer is heard saying, “He looks like a bad dude. Probably on something.” Officer Betty Shelby, who fired the shot that killed Crutcher, is on paid administrative leave. Calls to Jason Pappas, president of the Fraternal Order of Police’s Local 9 lodge in Ohio, were not immediately returned.        </mainText>
