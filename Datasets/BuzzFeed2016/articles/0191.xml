    <mainText>Trumpâs Campaign Manager was interrupted on CNN by Anderson Cooper after she said, âyouâve got all these little baby girls being killed just because theyâre girls in this country.â Without letting her finish, Anderson immediately stopped her: âWait, what Excuse me, where is that happening?â She then went on and tried to back up her statement by citing Planned Parenthood data, which was supposedly collected by the Guttmacher Institute report. But, Anderson Cooper wasnât buying it. âBut statistically, thereâs not really much evidence that that is actually occurring in the United States,â Cooper said. âAmongst some immigrant groups in small numbers it may be occurring but in no statistical measure is it significant.â Then â right after commercial break â Anderson Cooper again came back in order to set the record straight. The only thing Trumpâs campaign manager could do was force a fakeÂ smile. âBefore the break, Kellyanne, you mentioned the Guttmacher Institute information on sex-selective abortion in the United States,â Cooper said. âHereâs what they actually say in a May 30 press release titled âSex Selective Abortion Bans: A Disingenuous New Strategy to Limit Womenâs Access to Abortion.ââ âThe study acknowledges the practice does go on overseas, as we mentioned, and perhaps in certain Asian-American communities in the United States in small numbers,â Copper continued. âBut, quote, âIn the United States, meanwhile, there is limited data indicating that sex-selective abortion may be occurring in some Asian communities. Although the U.S. sex ratio at 1.05 males for every female is squarely within biologically normal parameters.â So I just wanted to put that out there.â </mainText>
