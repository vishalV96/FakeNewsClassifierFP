    <mainText>A powerful exchange between a veteran and a police officer in riot gear at the scene of the Charlotte riots is spreading like wildfire on social media. In the video, the veteran, whose name has not been revealed as of this writing, is seen talking directly to an officer with the Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department (CMPD) policing the ongoing protests at the scene of Keith Lamont Scott’s death. The officer, who is clad in body armor and wearing a face shield, is refusing to look the veteran in the eyes. Throughout the video, the veteran emotionally conveys his love for his country, emphasizes his lack of hatred for police officers, and pleads with the officer to give him an answer as to how many times he’s supposed to ignore repeated instances of police killing black people. “I’m a veteran, bro. I love my country. I wouldn’t have it any other way,” the man is seen saying to the officer. “When I look at you, I don’t hate you, man! But how many times do you expect me to look the other way?” WHO IS THIS?? Raw emotion from Charlotte.#KeithLamontScott#TerenceCrutcher#BlackLivesMatter pic.twitter.com/6srQkT8W0e — Unstripped Voice (@UnstrippedVoice) September 21, 2016  Early Wednesday morning, riots broke out on Old Concord Road in Charlotte, North Carolina, as protests escalated into confrontations with police. Anger over the fatal shooting of 43-year-old Keith Lamont Scott has reached a boiling point, with the CMPD reporting 12 officers injured as a result of the riots, and police firing tear gas on protesters.

They stress that the police’s account of events alleging Scott having a gun are patently false.

You can hear the pain &amp; frustration, and these BW will get the truth. pic.twitter.com/Eq2haoAKX8 — Tanee Jordan (@T_A_N_E_E) September 21, 2016  CMPD public affairs officer Keith Trietley said officers on the scene were searching for a suspect with an outstanding warrant when they encountered Scott, who was not the man they were looking for. After Scott exited the vehicle with an object in his hand, Trietley said officers perceived the situation as life-threatening and opened fire. “The subject got back out of the vehicle armed with a firearm and posed an imminent deadly threat to the officers who subsequently fired their weapon striking the subject,” Trietley said. According to MappingPoliceViolence.org, Keith Lamont Scott is the 214th black person to be killed by police in 2016. Officer Brentley Vinson, the officer who killed Scott, has been placed on paid administrative leave in the wake of the shooting.        </mainText>
