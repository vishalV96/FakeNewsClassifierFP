    <mainText>Usually, when I pass someone in a park, on a walk, or even when I get the mail – it is considered good manners to exchange some sort of pleasantry with the person you encounter. As a woman, I like to be reassured that that this is not someone with ill intent. This woman took it to the next level claiming ‘sexual harassment’ when a random white man dared to say ‘hello’ to her. *insert eyeroll*    This is why every claim of sexual harassment and rape must be investigated thoroughly. It’s sad to say, but you can’t just take a woman’s word for it anymore – mental health should always be looked into. If you see this, get your friend or family member some help – this is not normal behavior. Written by Katie McGuire.
