    <mainText>While most assuredly Obama, Hillary and other Democrat politicians struggle to find a “motive” for a man to stab eight people in a Minnesota shopping mall on Saturday evening, the Associated Press (AP) is reporting that ISIS-linked media is claiming that the evil animal doing the stabbing was a “soldier of the Islamic State.” So, they’re saying that it wasn’t “workplace violence?” BREAKING: IS-linked media claims Minnesota mall stabber was 'soldier of the Islamic State.' — The Associated Press (@AP) September 18, 2016  In other words, “RADICAL ISLAMIC TERRORISM.” Say it Hillary! Say it Obama! Say it! Moreover, the knife attacker referenced “Allah” during the attack and asked at least one victim if they were Muslim before assaulting, via a report from KSTP, the local ABC affiliate in the Twin Cities. BREAKING: St. Cloud mall stabbing attack suspect referenced Allah during attack, asked at least 1 victim if they were Muslim before assault — Steve Tellier KSTP (@stellierkstp) September 18, 2016  Thankfully, a good guy with a gun took the terrorist out before more violence could take place. KSTP reporter Steve Tellier also reports that all eight victims are expected to survive. It was off-duty police officer who fired shots that killed St. Cloud mall stabbing attack suspect inside mall &amp; ended attack. — Steve Tellier KSTP (@stellierkstp) September 18, 2016   Email Subscribe</mainText>
