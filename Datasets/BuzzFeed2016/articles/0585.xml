    <mainText>It seems as if our suspicions were correct from the onset. Hillary Clinton and her ‘physician’ are not telling the American people the truth about her health.

Still, the information Mrs. Clinton has made public is more extensive than the details … Full Story Here: How Healthy Is Hillary Clinton? Doctors Weigh In – The New York Times</mainText>
