    <mainText>It’s time for Episode 21 of the 2016 Nerdcast, POLITICO’s podcast on the race for the White House. Tune in each week to geek out with us as we dive deep into this amazing presidential race, the latest numbers that actually matter, plus backstage dope on how politics really works. We’re the people who spend Friday nights poring over poll numbers or the latest Federal Election Commission reports — so if you want to understand how the modern politics game is played, this is the podcast for you. (Subscribe to the 2016 Nerdcast on iTunes or download from Soundcloud here.) Story Continued Below POLITICO’s Kristin Roberts, Ken Vogel, Hadas Gold, Scott Bland and Katie Glueck discuss what can we expect from the first debate, the religious right’s conversion to Donald Trump, Trump as “strongman” and more.</mainText>
