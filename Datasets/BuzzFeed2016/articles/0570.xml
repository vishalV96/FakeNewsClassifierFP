It is not hard to say – terrorism, unless you’re NYC Mayor Bill de Blasio, who, like many apologists on the left, just couldn’t bring himself to utter the word. When pressed, he merely stated… Read the rest of the story at www.iPatriot.com  The views expressed in this opinion article are solely those of their author and are not necessarily either shared or endorsed by EagleRising.com Get your daily dose of Eagle Rising by entering your email address below.</mainText>
