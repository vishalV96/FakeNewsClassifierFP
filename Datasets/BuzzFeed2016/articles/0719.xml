    <mainText>The Drudge Report has gained access to the rules for the upcoming Mega-Debate between Hillary and Trump. Hillary’s always angling for an advantage, and when it comes to the mainstream media, Hillary usually gets exactly what she wants. It looks like she’ll get a custom podium to help her with the height advantage, but when it comes to coughing up a lung, Hillary’s on her own. Let’s hope for Hillary’s sake, she’s able to keep the guy with the diazinon pen close to the stage in case “unfit to run for office Hillary” has another “pneumonia-related incident” like the one on 911…  DEBATE RULES: NO COUGHING BREAKS **Exclusive** Fri Sep 23 2016 11:30:40 ET If presidential hopeful Hillary Clinton slips into a coughing fit or any other medical crisis during Monday’s high-stakes debate, she will have to power through, the DRUDGE REPORT has learned! “There are no commercial breaks,” a commission source explains. “Period.” Debate moderator Lester Holt does not have the authority to cut away from the stage during the epic 90-minute showdown. And microphone audio for either of the candidates is not to be manipulated. Clinton has experienced severe coughing episodes throughout the election year. During a Labor Day campaign stop she suffered a 4-minute choking marathon. Monday’s throwdown could top out at 100 million viewers, making it the biggest political event in history. EDITOR’S NOTE: The presidential debate commission settled an early flashpoint when Clinton demanded a step-stool at the podium to add height to her 5’4″ frame. Campaign Chairman John Podesta expressed concern that Hillary would be dwarfed by 6’2″ Trump. The request was quickly rejected. The commission is allowing for a custom-made podium, which will accommodate the difference in stature. </mainText>
