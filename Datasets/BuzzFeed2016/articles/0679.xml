    <mainText>Over the weekend, Barack Obama addressed the Congressional Black Caucus for the last time as President. He hammered the Republican nominee and admonished black voters to vote for the Democratic nominee. He said he’d take it as a “personal insult” for members of the Black community not to vote for her. Here’s what he said: “If I hear anybody saying their vote does not matter, that it doesn’t matter who we elect — read up on your history. It matters. We’ve got to get people to vote,” Obama said. “I will consider it a personal insult — an insult to my legacy — if this community lets down its guard and fails to activate itself in this election. You want to give me a good sendoff? Go vote.” Well, there’s at least one member of the Black community who doesn’t care that it would be a personal insult to the president for him to vote not only against Hillary, but for Donald Trump. He goes by A.D. Bell, and according to his Twitter profile, he’s an “Army Vet, Realist Party Affil., Father, College Graduate, Man, Not a Liberal or a Conservative.” In his video, Bell asks the President what he’s going to do to him, since he’s voting for Trump. When people say they’re “insulted,” they act on it, he said. “So, what are you going to do to me, Mr. Obama?” an incensed Bell asked. “I feel like liberals and Democrats have insulted me for a long time. I feel like liberals and Democrats have insulted black people for a long time.” “You know what I’m doing?! I’m voting against them!” he yelled, pointing to his camouflage ‘Make America Great Again’ hat.
