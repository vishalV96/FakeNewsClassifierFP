    <mainText>“By the way, my tax cut is the biggest since Ronald Reagan — I'm very proud of it.” — Donald Trump Donald Trump’s tax cut would actually be even larger than Ronald Reagan’s 1981 tax cut. Trump's latest revision of his tax plan is estimated to cost between $4.4 trillion and $5.9 trillion, according to the Tax Foundation, or an annual average of $440 billion annually. By comparison, Reagan's 1981 tax cuts reduced taxes by an average $200 billion annually (in 2012 dollars), according to the Treasury Department. Some of those tax cuts were later rescinded when they ballooned the deficit. George W. Bush’s 2001 tax cut had an average cost of $91.5 billion annually, according to a 2013 Treasury analysis, while his 2003 cuts cost $84 billion annually.</mainText>
