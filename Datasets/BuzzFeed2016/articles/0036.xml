    <mainText>Former President George H.W. Bush said he will be voting for Hillary Clinton at a reception for the Points of Light Foundation in Kennebunkport, Maine, on Monday, a source told ABC News. Bush made the declaration in front of about 40 people in attendance at the reception, according to the source. Kathleen Hartington Kennedy Townsend, a former Maryland lieutenant governor and daughter of Robert F. Kennedy, first posted on Facebook Monday about the 41st president's apparent intentions to vote for Clinton, sharing a photo of herself and Bush, and writing, "The President told me he’s voting for Hillary!!" Townsend later told Politico she met with Bush, 92, in Maine on Monday, where he told her about his preference in this year’s ballot. "That's what he said," she told Politico.       Townsend is a member of the advisory board of the Points of Light Foundation. "The vote President Bush will cast as a private citizen in some 50 days will be just that: a private vote cast in some 50 days," a spokesman for Bush told ABC News. "He is not commenting on the presidential race in the interim."</mainText>
