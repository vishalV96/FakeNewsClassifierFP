    <mainText>About the survey The CNN/KFF Poll was conducted by telephone August 9-September 5 among 1,614 adults, including 701 who were identified as working-class whites -- white non-Hispanic adults who do not hold a four-year degree and, if under age 25, are not currently enrolled in school. Results for all working-class white voters have a margin of sampling error of +/-5 percentage points; it is 6 points for results among white working-class voters who support Trump.
