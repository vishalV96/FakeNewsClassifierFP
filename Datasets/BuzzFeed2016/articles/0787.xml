    <mainText>You know that kid who is always trying to fit in? But no matter what they do they just seem a little off. The way they walk swinging, their arms unnaturally. Or they’re out with their other 2 buddies and there are only 2 barstools at the bar, so they stand behind the other guys trying to stand just right to look cool. Or they try to tell a joke but don’t really get the punch line right? Sad dorks have a hard life. If there is one thing that everyone can do (even a dork) and not totally mess up is take a selfie, right? You get to make funny faces, wear goofy clothes or anything in a selfie is deemed acceptable. In this video you will see a bunch of Muslims (I assume extremists) sitting around some guns as if the guns were a campfire. They are chanting some sort of song and everyone seems to be having a good time until the weird dude in the group decides to capture the moment with a selfie to PROVE he has friends. Remember, this is easy, you can’t mess it up. UNLESS you forget that the phone you are using is also a phone detonator to the bombs in the middle of the room. WOOPS! BOOM*&amp;%^#!!!
