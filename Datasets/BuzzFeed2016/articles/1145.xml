    <mainText>President Barack Obama joked Thursday that actor Morgan Freeman couldn’t make it to a White House ceremony for National Medals of the Arts and Humanities recipients because he “undoubtedly is off playing a black president again.” “He never lets me have my moment,” the president added once the laughter subsided. Story Continued Below Obama also quipped that Thursday’s medal recipients included NPR host Terry Gross “and a whole bunch of people who Terry Gross has interviewed.” Legendary comedy writer and director Mel Brooks got top billing at the ceremony, which also honored chef Jose Andres, jazz musician Wynton Marsalis and author Sandra Cisneros, among others. “As Mel Brooks once said to his writers on 'Blazing Saddles,' which is a great film, ‘Write anything you want because we’ll never be heard from again. We will all be arrested for this movie,’” the president said in his introductory remarks. “Now to be fair, Mel also said, a little more eloquently, that every human being has hundreds of separate people living inside his skin and the talent of a writer is his ability to give them their separate names, identities, personalities and have them relate to other characters living within him,” Obama continued. “And that I think, is [what] the arts and humanities do: They lift up our identities and make us see ourselves in each other.”</mainText>
