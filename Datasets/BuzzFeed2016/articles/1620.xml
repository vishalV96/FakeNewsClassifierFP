    <mainText>The Bloomberg network will run a live, on-screen fact check during tonight’s presidential debate, breaking precedent with other networks. Politico reported Monday morning that Bloomberg would be verifying the factual accuracy of statements by both Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton and Republican nominee Donald Trump in real time on the screen. Other networks have opted out of doing a live fact check, mostly because it would be too difficult. The Clinton campaign has called repeatedly for a live fact check of the debate in anticipation of Trump’s penchant for making unverifiable claims on live TV. “For the moderator to let lies like that that come out of his mouth at this debate to go unchallenged would give Donald Trump an unfair advantage,” said Clinton Communications Director Jennifer Palmieri in a conference call with reporters. “We do believe it is the role of the moderator . . . to call out those lies and to do that in real time.” This would largely leave it up to moderator Lester Holt to call out each candidate when making a false statement. However, this could prove too controversial for Holt, who would invite criticism much in the same way CNN’s Candy Crowley did in 2012, when she interrupted Mitt Romney on the topic of the Banghazi attacks while moderating a debate between Romney and President Barack Obama. However, not correcting a candidate when he or she misstates the facts can also stir up controversy. The most recentl example of that is Today Show anchor Matt Lauer choosing not to interject during one of Donald Trump’s responses to his questions, when the GOP nominee said he never supported the Iraq War (he did). And while networks have said they would fact-check each candidates’ statements in followup pieces to run the following day, it still essentially frees up both candidates to lie without being interrupted. The debate, which will take place at Hofstra University in New York, airs at 9 PM Eastern tonight on CNN. Neither Libertarian nominee Gary Johnson nor Green Party nominee Jill Stein have been invited to join the debate. For her part, Stein will be hosting a livestream outside Hofstra University where she will be answering all questions asked by a live social media audience.            </mainText>
