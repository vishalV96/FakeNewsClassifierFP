    <mainText>ORLANDO -- Tim Kaine visited the Pulse night club here on Monday evening, the site where gunman Omar Mateen killed 49 people in June. The Virginia senator laid flowers at a memorial surrounding the club. He attended alongside former Rep. Gabby Giffords (D-Ariz.), who was injured in a mass shooting in 2011, as well as Giffords's husband astronaut Mark Kelly and Sen. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.). Story Continued Below "The thing that's painful about this: this is a weird thing to say but I always hoped that Virginia Tech would be the worst one ever," Kaine told reporters after a quiet, 10-minute visit to the site. "As bad as that was, I hoped nothing would ever eclipse it. But such is life. We got work to do." Kaine was Virginia's governor in 2007, when a shooter killed 32 people at the university. Later Monday, Kaine, Giffords and Kelly are scheduled to attend a presidential debate watch party with LGBT activists here in Orlando. Kaine's running mate, Hillary Clinton, visited Pulse in July.</mainText>
