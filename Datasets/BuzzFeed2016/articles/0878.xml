    <mainText>The University of North Dakota is investigating a racist Snapchat post depicting three white students locking out a black student from her own dorm room, according to the Grand Forks Herald. Etonde Maloke, a friend of the victim, shared in a Facebook post on Tuesday a picture of three white students laughing together in a dorm room. The photo features the caption, “Locked the black bitch out.” The white students had actually posted the offensive photo on the black student’s Snapchat account. “My friend left her phone in her room and the three kids pictured below took her phone and took the snapchat pictured below,” Maloke explained. “They captioned it ‘locked the black bitch out’. My friend was not aware that they had done this and didn’t even realize they had put this on her snapchat story until another friend of ours pointed it out.” “We all know Racism is alive and well (whether you like to admit it not),” she wrote. “When said acts of racism happen at your school, it is infuriating and heart breaking.” I’m so livid!! We all know Racism is alive and well (whether you like to admit it not). When said acts of racism happen… Posted by Etonde Maloke on Tuesday, September 20, 2016 The University of North Dakota posted a statement to Twitter, saying it was “in the process of gathering information.” “What is portrayed is not part of the community values that we expound,” the statement said. “We take seriously issues related to respect for all.” pic.twitter.com/XkXpL0tYEa — Univ of North Dakota (@myUND) September 21, 2016       </mainText>
