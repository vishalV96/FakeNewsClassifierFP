    <mainText>First a pipe bomb exploded on the Jersey Shore, then New York was next. Now, pipe bombs have been found in a New Jersey train station. According to the New York Daily News, “authorities discovered three pipe bombs and two smaller devices at a train station in Elizabeth.”   NEW JERSEY: Elizabeth Mayor says a bag with wires and pipes was found in a trash can near NJT Station, FBI on scene. https://t.co/q60LGGS52o — KolHaolam (@KolHaolam) September 19, 2016   Since all of these bombs have been found in a relatively small area, it seems likely that a small team or even a single individual is behind it. Although Islamic terrorism would seem to be the most likely explanation, there have been “mad bombers” who’ve done this sort of thing before (See Ted Kaczynski &amp; George Metesky). Is their motive simply to cause terror? Are they trying to create mass casualties, but failing to do so? We don’t know yet. However, the FBI has arrested 5 people they believe may be connected to the Chelsea bombing investigation. That being said, none of these people have been charged, which could mean they’re collecting evidence or alternately, these people may end up having nothing to do with the case.  Goodnight!
