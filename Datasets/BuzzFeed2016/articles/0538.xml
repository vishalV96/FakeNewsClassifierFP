    <mainText>Please disable your Ad Blocker in order to interact with the site. The establishment and complicit media is already in full cover-up mode to save Hillary in the polls. Here is the full cover up as it has already begun. Hillary Clinton calling the explosions in Chelsea, New York a bombing and then directly after making that statements a press correspondent asked her how she felt about Donald Trump taking the stage and calling it a bombing. To which of course she made the statement “it’s wiser to wait” – watch and be disgusted with the complicit media and the democrat nominee for president of the United States not even remember what they said moments before. </mainText>
