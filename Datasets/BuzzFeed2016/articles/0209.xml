    <mainText>Donald Trumpâs campaign manager Kellyanne Conway was backed into a proverbial corner on MSNBCâs Morning Joe trying to defend Trumpâs latest comments. Bloomberg Politics host Mark Halperin first called her out on the fact that Trump called the debateâs moderator a DemocratÂ when that wasnât even true. And, Conwayâs response? Trump didnât lie, he just didnât know. Hereâs Halperin: âHe said Lester Holt (the debate moderator) was a Democrat. Lester Holt is a Republican. How could he say such a thing that just black-and-white factually incorrect?â âI donât know that he knew what Lester Holtâs voter registration is,â Conway said. Conway tried to pivot, saying âfirst of all, if you tell me the media are not overly populated with Democrats, thatâs false,â but Holt just wasnât buying it. âIâm asking about a very specific thing,â Halperin said. âHe made a factual claim about the moderator who deserves the right to be treated fairly and it was just wrong. And itâs a metaphor for his frequently in public stating things with no basis, that are wrong.â After much back and forth, Halperin just became exasperated trying to get an answer out of her. âYouâre not answering what I asked you,â Halperin said. âIâm asking you how someone running for president can assert on the eve of the debate that the moderator is a Democrat, which is factually incorrect? How can he do that?â .@KellyannePolls: Trump âdidnât lieâ about Lester Holt, âa lie would mean that he knew the manâs party registrationâ https://t.co/dZWTCwpoim â Morning Joe (@Morning_Joe) September 26, 2016 </mainText>
