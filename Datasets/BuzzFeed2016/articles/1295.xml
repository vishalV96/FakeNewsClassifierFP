    <mainText>“[Trump is] someone who has said pregnancy is an inconvenience to employers.”— Hillary Clinton “I never said that.” — Donald Trump Trump did make such a claim. In a 2004 interview with NBC’s “Dateline,” Trump said pregnancy is “a wonderful thing for the woman, it’s a wonderful thing for the husband, it's certainly an inconvenience for a business. And whether people want to say that or not, the fact is it is an inconvenience for a person that is running a business.”</mainText>
