    <mainText>A poll of voters nationwide and focus groups in swing states show voters believe Hillary Clinton was the clear winner in Monday night’s debate. In a CNN/ORC poll of voters watching the debate live on CNN, the former Secretary of State was named the winner by an almost three to one margin. 62 percent of CNN viewers thought the Democratic nominee won the debate, while just 27 percent of viewers thought Trump prevailed in the 90-minute, commercial-free slugfest. Who won? Per CNN's poll of debate watchers: Clinton: 62% Trump: 27% pic.twitter.com/y7RCwXxrhN — Dan Diamond (@ddiamond) September 27, 2016  Public Policy Polling (PPP) also conducted its own nationwide poll of voters, and found that Hillary Clinton was again the favorite by a 51-40 margin among a survey of 1,002 debate watchers who had been pre-selected to give their thoughts immediately after the debate. Among the poll’s key findings were that 63 percent of young voters thought Clinton won, while just 24 percent named Trump as the victor. Clinton won by 54-36 among women voters, and by a whopping 77-13 margin among voters who identified as either African American or Latino. However, Trump was named the winner among white voters by a slim 47-45 margin. PPP also asked respondents if either candidate could be trusted with nuclear weapons. Those surveyed said Clinton could be trusted with the nation’s nuclear arsenal by a 56-35 margin, while voters said Donald Trump could not be trusted with nuclear weapons by a 42-51 margin. Perhaps most importantly, focus groups of voters in two key swing states overwhelmingly thought Hillary Clinton won the Hofstra debate over Trump. A CNN focus group of 20 undecided Florida voters found that 18 of the 20 voters in the sample thought Clinton won the debate. Another focus group of 22 voters in Pennsylvania, surveyed by conservative strategist Frank Luntz, found that 16 thought Clinton won the debate, while just 6 thought Trump won. 18 of 20 voters in CNN focus group in Florida say Clinton won debate tonight, @PamelaBrownCNN reports — Manu Raju (@mkraju) September 27, 2016  Who won tonite's debate? In my focus group, 6 people said Trump and 16 said Clinton. #DebateNight You can say here: https://t.co/rFZYklEsdr — Frank Luntz (@FrankLuntz) September 27, 2016  The remaining presidential debates will take place next month. Vice presidential nominees Tim Kaine and Mike Pence will square off on October 4, while Clinton and Trump will debate again on October 9 and October 19.        </mainText>
