    <mainText>Jill Stein didn't get invited to the first presidential debate, but the Green Party candidate is still hoping to cause a stir. In the hours before Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton take the stage, Stein and her supporters plan to hold a "Let Jill Debate" protest and subsequent "People's Debate." Story Continued Below Both events are to be held outside Hofstra University in Hempstead, New York, the site of Monday's debate. When the debate starts at 9 p.m., Stein's campaign says she will "participate live in the debate on social media." Stein didn't pass the 15 percent national polling threshold to qualify for the debate, and neither did Libertarian Party presidential nominee Gary Johnson. Johnson's campaign said he, along with running mate Bill Weld, will be New York City on debate day. The pair plan to watch the debate live and live-tweet from their Twitter accounts.</mainText>
