    <mainText>This should come as no surprise to most of us, but Trump supporter Don King let the âN-wordâ slip out during a recent speech in an Ohio Church. Itâs also unlikely that youâll be surprised at the fact that Trump was sitting right behind him, smiling with glee when it happened. Trump LOVED hearing the âN-wordâ (screenshot) CNN commentator Angela RyeÂ spoke about this terrible incident with a Trump supporter, and the racism behind the Trump campaign got even worse. When Rye asked white Trump surrogate Joseph Borelli to âPlease tell me that you understandâ how offensive it was to use the âN-wordâ in 2016, she didnât quite get the answer she was hoping for. In fact, it was the exact opposite. The white panelist basically said that since rappers use the âN-wordâ, itâs fair game for Don King and everyone else. Borelli said: âHave you not listened to music where other African-Americans use language far worse than this?â Rye couldnât believe her ears, andÂ gave Borelli a chance to save himself as she begged, âPlease donât do that to me. Please donât do that to me, today.â And of course, the dense Trump supporter didnât take the hint: âI am going to do it, though. You canât say that Don King is saying a word that is now suddenly unacceptable. Itâs not one that I would use, but itâs perhaps a word that Don King would use.â Thatâs when Rye went off and tore him a new one. In making her point, Rye warned, âWhat Iâm saying to you,Â is this trivializes your candidateâs black outreach.â You can watch Rye shred Borelli below: @CorporateBarbie@metroadlib RT @keithboykin: .@angela_rye for the win! #DonKingpic.twitter.com/otd8owrCU7 â Thanks for Asking (@ykesha2001) September 21, 2016 Rye also didnât hesitate to point out the fact that Trump was smirking during the âN-wordâ-heavy speech, which will undoubtedly create more trust issues with African American voters: .@angela_rye on Trump surrogate using the N word during a minority outreach event https://t.co/fVy4GUzMZU â Eugene Scott (@Eugene_Scott) September 21, 2016  </mainText>
