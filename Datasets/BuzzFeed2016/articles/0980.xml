    <mainText>CNN will host a town hall with President Barack Obama next week, the channel announced Monday. CNN’s chief Washington correspondent Jake Tapper will moderate “CNN Presidential Town Hall: America’s Military and the Commander in Chief,” which will center around national security, veterans issues and foreign policy as it relates to the U.S. military. The town hall, which will air at 9 p.m. on September 28, will be held in Fort Lee, Virginia. At the event, Obama will take questions from the audience, which will be comprised of service members, veterans and others in the military community, the cable channel said. The town hall will be available on the cable channel and online, and will also stream in virtual reality.</mainText>
