    <mainText>Politico POLITICO's must-read briefing on what's driving the day in Washington DONALD TRUMP has not held an open press availability in 56 days, and last night his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, told Erin Burnett on CNN that Trump “gives press availability every day by doing these rallies in these swing states.” That is not the same thing. (H/t Sopan Deb) Good Wednesday morning from Capitol Hill. Want free breakfast? The PLAYBOOK FOOD TRUCK is near the Capitol South Metro now, and will stay there until 10 a.m. today. Egg Sandwiches. Coffee. TOMORROW, which, for the record, is Thursday, we’ll be on the Senate side (location to come tomorrow, but it will be easily accessible for commuters). ON FRIDAY we’ll be at 17th and K for our downtown friends. M HILLARY CLINTON is in Orlando today, and will “talk about building an ‘Inclusive Economy’ – one that works for every American, not just those at the top – and that to compete and win in the global economy, we can't afford to leave anyone on the sidelines … The ideas she’ll talk about – that everyone has something to contribute in our country – date back to Clinton’s book ‘It Takes a Village,’” per a campaign official. She also previewed the speech in the New York Times: http://nyti.ms/2clD2gU Story Continued Below **SUBSCRIBE to Playbook: http://politi.co/1M75UbX UNGA BUNGLE -- “Trump Gives Ukraine Cold Shoulder in New York,” by Foreign Policy’s Molly O’Toole and Reid Standish: “Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump already has a contentious relationship with Kiev, irking the Ukrainian public and government officials with his praise of Russian President Vladimir Putin and Moscow-friendly views on the annexation of Crimea and the war in eastern Ukraine. Now, invited to meet with Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko on the sidelines of the United Nations General Assembly this week, Trump’s campaign didn’t even bother to send Kiev an RSVP. “A spokesperson for the Ukrainian presidential administration told Foreign Policy they reached out to both Trump and his Democratic rival, former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, to meet with Poroshenko. According to the official, only Clinton said yes, sitting down with the president on Monday. The Trump campaign did not give a clear answer. Trump’s campaign did not provide comment about the so-far snub by the time of publication. But according to the candidate’s public schedule, he’s already jetted to North Carolina and has plans to be in Ohio and Pennsylvania the rest of the week, not in New York, where the U.N. meeting ends on Sept. 26, the day of the first presidential debate.” http://atfp.co/2d7MYfG NEW TRUMP AD -- “Movement” -- SCRIPT: “It’s a movement. Not a campaign. It’s leader, Donald Trump, builder, businessman, success. Doing what others called impossible. Donald Trump’s priority: you. Dreaming big. Building bigger. United for family, jobs, country, defined by freedom, standing together, pushing ahead, leaving the past behind, changing our future. Together, we’ll make America great again.” http://bit.ly/2ctccHa SIREN -- AP: “Early ballots: Clinton sees strength in NC but lags in Iowa”: “Seven weeks before Election Day, the earliest numbers from advance voting for president show initial strength for Hillary Clinton in swing state North Carolina, good news for Donald Trump in battleground Iowa and a record number of requests for ballots in Ohio.” http://apne.ws/2cQKeUy -- “Tom Steyer puts more money into voter turnout machine,” by LATimes’ H. Charley Bodkin: “Tom Steyer -- the San Francisco billionaire, political donor and environmental advocate -- said Tuesday he would put $20 million of his own money behind a campaign to mobilize 2 million voters in eight swing states to boost support for Democrat Hillary Clinton. The overall effort, which includes partnerships with labor groups, is expected to cost $55 million, Steyer told Lawrence O'Donnell on MSNBC. He said they’ll be focusing on ‘economic justice, environmental justice, racial justice and good schools’ and targeting 200 college campuses.” http://lat.ms/2d3T44S HOT IN RIYADH -- IMPORTANT STORY -- “Dems waver on override for 9/11 bill,” by Seung Min Kim and Heather Caygle: “Democrats are starting to show cracks in their support for legislation that would allow families of 9/11 victims to sue Saudi Arabia -- suggesting White House opposition to the bill may be resonating with lawmakers. But to sustain his expected veto, Obama will need to persuade 34 senators to change course and oppose the bill -- a very difficult task. The legislation sailed through both chambers with no opposition. And the White House now has scant time to make their case to Capitol Hill, with a veto override vote in the Senate expected this month.” http://politi.co/2dhKdvx --WHY THIS MATTERS: If Congress overrides the president’s veto, that would mark a major defeat on Capitol Hill for the White House. It would be the first Congressional override of a veto of Barack Obama’s presidency. As SMK and Heather point out in their story, McConnell wants to hold the veto override vote before Congress leaves for the fall campaign season, which doesn’t give the Obama administration a ton of time to press its argument. White House press secretary Josh Earnest said: “As we’ve made this case, members of Congress in both parties have indicated that they are open to the concerns that we’ve expressed. In many cases, they share them. And the real question for members of Congress will be whether or not they’re prepared to cast a vote that is consistent with the views and feelings that they expressed in private.” SPOILER ALERT: Members of Congress oftentimes say one thing in private, and do something completely contradictory in public. Welcome to Washington! **** A message from BP: Over the past 10 years, no energy company has invested more in the U.S. than BP – $90 billion in total. Take 90 seconds to see what else we’re doing to help keep America moving forward. ****** DRIP DRIP -- “Trump used $258,000 from his charity to settle legal problems,” by WashPost’s David A. Fahrenthold: “If the Internal Revenue Service were to find that Trump violated self-dealing rules, the agency could require him to pay penalty taxes or to reimburse the foundation for all the money it spent on his behalf. ... More broadly, these cases also provide new evidence that Trump ran his charity in a way that may have violated U.S. tax law and gone against the moral conventions of philanthropy.” http://wapo.st/2cPwr2e --@SopanDeb: “.@JasonMillerinDC releases statement accusing @Fahrenthold of inaccuracies and bias, but doesn’t list specifics (I have asked.)”: http://bit.ly/2cCl6Qg DAILY DONALD -- After the Washington Post ran a story with the headline “Donald Trump’s new paid maternity leave plan might exclude single mothers,” they appended an update: “Update: After this story published, Trump campaign spokesman Jason Miller told The Post that Trump’s paid maternity leave policy would extend to single mothers. However, he could not explain why a marriage requirement is cited on the campaign’s website and in Ivanka Trump’s Cosmopolitan interview. ‘We don’t have the exact legislation written down,’ he said.” FOR YOUR RADAR -- “Obama Administration Considers Arming Syrian Kurds Against ISIS,” by the NYT’s Eric Schmitt: “The Obama administration is weighing a military plan to directly arm Syrian Kurdish fighters combating the Islamic State, a major policy shift that could speed up the offensive against the terrorist group but also sharply escalate tensions between Turkey and the United States. The plan has been under discussion by the National Security Council staff at a moment when President Obama has directed aides to examine all proposals that could accelerate the fight against the Islamic State ... Mr. Obama has told aides that he wants an offensive well underway before he leaves office that is aimed at routing the Islamic State from Raqqa, the group’s de facto capital in northern Syria.” http://nyti.ms/2d1o96n -- AP: “Man wounded after attempt to enter Israeli Embassy in Turkey”: “An attacker apparently armed with a knife tried to enter the Israeli Embassy in Turkey on Wednesday before being shot and slightly wounded by Turkish security officials, an Israeli official said. Emmanuel Nahshon told The Associated Press that all Israeli Embassy staff were safe and the attacker was captured. ‘The attacker was wounded before he reached the embassy," Nashon said in a statement in Jerusalem. ‘A person approached the embassy with a knife. He was lightly wounded by a local security man in the leg,’ he said.” http://apne.ws/2clIvEn HAPPENING TODAY -- Donald Trump will hold a rally at the Stranahan Theater in Toledo, Ohio, with Mike Pence. Hillary Clinton will be in Orlando, at the Frontline Outreach Youth and Family Center. Bill Clinton is addressing his Clinton Global Initiative for the last time (Annie Karni previews his speech here: http://politi.co/2cPTI3V). President Barack Obama is in New York, and will speak at the U.S.-Africa Business Forum at the Plaza Hotel. He’ll then hold bilateral meetings with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu of Israel and President Juan Manuel Santos of Colombia. He’ll return to D.C. in the afternoon. YOU’RE INVITED! -- Join us for Playbook Cocktails TONIGHT with civil rights icon, Rep. John Lewis (D-Ga.)! Our conversation comes during the opening week of the Smithsonian’s National Museum of African American History and Culture. We’ll talk about civil rights and explore Lewis’s extraordinary life. Doors open at 5:30 p.m. The W Hotel, 515 15th Street, NW. RSVP here http://bit.ly/2cvXEEd CAMPAIGN CASH UPDATE -- “Trump forces lagged Clinton in August money race [by $42 million]: But Trump finally showed signs of building a more conventional political infrastructure,” by Isaac Arnsdorf and Ken Vogel: “The Trump campaign, two supportive super PACs and the [RNC] pulled in a combined $70 million, relying largely on small donors, during the tumultuous month of August ... By contrast, the Clinton campaign, an allied super PAC and the [DNC], leaning heavily on major donors, raised a total of $112 million in August.” http://politi.co/2cQyPUT -- “Clinton campaign raced through $50 million last month,” by AP’s Julie Bykowicz and Chad Day: “Hillary Clinton spent $645,000 more a day than her opponent Donald Trump last month, but even with her $50 million campaign outlay, she has not been able to pull away from him in the race for the White House. Clinton’s campaign had its most expensive month to date in August, eclipsing its previous monthly high by more than $12 million. And combined, Clinton and the national Democratic Party paid out $78 million in August, while Trump and the [RNC] spent about $47 million.” http://apne.ws/2d1miP1 THE PRIDE OF GREENWICH -- “The Bush family’s lament: They detest the GOP nominee, and now have become his foil,” by Eli Stokols: “Their distaste for Donald Trump was no secret. But they saw no point in publicizing it. From Miami to Houston, Crawford to Kennebunkport, members of the Republican Party’s first family remained quiet for months, avoiding cameras and questions about presidential politics and focusing their few fundraiser appearances on assisting the GOP candidates who would be forced to share the November ballot with a nominee they detest. But given the Bush clan’s proximity to public life, and their progeny’s desire to one day return the family to power, it was only a matter of time before their tongues would be held no longer. Over a 24-hour span that began with Jeb Bush’s surprising and sardonic cameo in Sunday’s Emmy Awards broadcast and Monday night’s reports that his father, former President George H.W. Bush, had told a family friend privately that he intended to support Hillary Clinton, the Bushes returned to the headlines, and are giving Trump just the establishment foil he so capably exploits … “George W. Bush, who is headed to Washington this weekend to headline a fundraiser for Senate Republicans and attend the opening of the National African American History Museum, has shared in private settings for months about his fear that he will be ‘the last Republican president.’ And while Bush family loyalists say they do not know if he is joking, they are certain he cannot support Trump.” http://politi.co/2clDmMH GOVT FUNDING WATCH -- “Senate advances budget deal that doesn’t exist yet,” by Ben Weyl, Seung Min Kim, and Burgess Everett: “Mitch McConnell summoned his Republican Conference to a late afternoon meeting Tuesday with an unusual ask: Would his colleagues support moving forward on a spending deal that doesn’t even exist yet? The answer, surprisingly, was yes. The Senate voted 89-7 on Tuesday evening to move forward on a bill that will eventually be used to fund the government through Dec. 9 and deliver $1.1 billion to fight the Zika epidemic. A bloc of conservatives voted no, but the measure easily cleared the 60-vote threshold to avoid a filibuster, powered by votes from Senate Democrats, centrist Republicans and GOP senators up for reelection.” http://politi.co/2cHpBy4 TERRORISM LATEST -- “Bomb suspect vowed ‘death to your oppression,’ feds say,” by AP’s Eric Tucker, Larry Neumeister and Jennifer Peltz: “Federal court complaints filed Tuesday gave a chilling glimpse into what authorities say motivated the Afghan-born U.S. citizen to set off explosives last weekend in New York City and New Jersey, including a bomb that injured 31 people in Manhattan.

Verizon-owned streaming platform Go90 has ordered six half-hour episodes of the political comedy ‘Embeds.’ The series will follow five young reporters who are in way over their heads as they find themselves shaping the future of the country while experiencing raucous adventures in an unexpected world of sex, drugs, and swing states. Big-name politicians are expected to cameo throughout the series. ... “Scott Conroy, co-author of the bestselling Sarah Palin biography ‘Sarah From Alaska,’ and Peter Hamby, a former CNN correspondent who is now head of Snapchat’s news efforts, co-created the show and penned the pilot. ...

INSKEEP: “Are you sure you are going to be able to make life better once Brexit is complete?” MAY: “There are opportunities for us once Brexit is complete and I’m absolutely clear that we are going to take those opportunities. We’re going to make a success and people will see a difference. I, what I said about my government is that it will be a government that will work with everyone. I want to see an economy that works for everyone and a society that works for everyone in the UK and that’s about spreading the benefits of economic growth across the country and among people. And there’s a number of ways in which we will do that. I think leaving the European Union with the opportunities it gives us for the trading relationships around the rest of the world will be an important part of that.” http://n.pr/2dg8Juc --PEOPLE’s interview with Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine -- On her recent sick days at home, Clinton said she did “bounce off the walls a little bit – I’m not great at taking it easy.” Kaine on his role as the No. 2 to the potential first female president: “She’s the boss.
