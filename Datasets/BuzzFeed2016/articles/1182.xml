    <mainText>President Barack Obama wants Hillary Clinton to “be yourself and explain what motivates you” when she takes the stage Monday night for her first presidential debate. Obama offered the advice during an interview on ABC with “Good Morning America” host Robin Roberts from the soon-to-open National Museum of African-American History and Culture on the National Mall. The two spent the bulk of their interview discussing the museum and what lessons it might offer for protesters in Charlotte who have at times become violent.
