    <mainText>Tonight's presidential debate between Hillary Clinton and Donald Trump is must-see TV, and many celebrities will be watching from home, as well as from the front row. Billionaire entrepreneur and "Shark Tank" co-star Mark Cuban has confirmed that he will be taking a front-row seat at the debate at Hofstra University on Long Island in New York to cheer on Team Hillary.  Just got a front row seat to watch @HillaryClinton overwhelm @realDonaldTrump at the "Humbling at Hofstra" on Monday. It Is On !  "Obviously, I'm a not a Trump fan. I am a Clinton fan," Cuban told ABC News today at the red carpet season premiere of "Shark Tank." "I think she'd make a great president. "I don't think he's got the skill set," he said about Trump. "Let's put it this way, if he came on 'Shark Tank,' I wouldn't make the investment. I just don't see him as being capable in the least bit." Trump quickly responded to the news by tweeting that he was considering inviting Gennifer Flowers, the variety show performer who famously had an affair with Bill Clinton before he became president.  If dopey Mark Cuban of failed Benefactor fame wants to sit in the front row, perhaps I will put Gennifer Flowers right alongside of him!  Although Trump's campaign manager told ABC News' George Stephanopoulos that Trump did not actually invite Flowers, it seems she was willing to accept the invitation.  Hi Donald. You know I'm in your corner and will definitely be at the debate!...??      Meanwhile, other celebrities are gearing up to watch the first debate between the two candidates. Here's what they are saying on social media:  Ready for #mudslingmonday #YOUGOTTHISHRC pic.twitter.com/0lbXPnUKDD   May angels stand guard at the debate tonight. Sending love, blessing, protection, hope...   My goal in life is to refrain from tweeting during debate. as the kiddies say #lifegoals   I feel like something BIG is going to happen tomorrow. pic.twitter.com/oIy0nCxirb   1. Will U be watching the debate tomorrow? 2. Will you be watching with an open mind or is your mind made up? 3. What snack will U B having?   Why would they schedule a debate on a Monday Night Football Night?? Guess it makes sense to somebody.   For the debates on Monday, I'm thinking of serving skewers. With Cheetos and skittles for munchies, of course.   To level the field at the debates tonight, Hillary Clinton will be administered anesthesia, and all questions will be read to her in German.   Can not wait to watch the Trump - Clinton debate,this Monday..I'm betting that the shorter of the two blonds will prevail..   Only 50 more days til we find out who's our next President! Last time I was nauseous 50 days straight, at least I got a baby out of it! </mainText>
