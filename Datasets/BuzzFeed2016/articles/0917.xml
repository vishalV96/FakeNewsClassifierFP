    <mainText>During tonight’s debate, Republican nominee Donald Trump said that he received a “small loan” from his father to begin his business career. That “small loan” was for over a million dollars, and his father continued to give him financial backing throughout the early years of his career. His “success” is proof of the adage that you “need money to make money,” as he borrowed $14 million from his father and received a blind trust fund which gave him another million. Trump complained to POLITICO that “It has not been easy for me. It has not been easy for me. I started off in Brooklyn. My father gave me a small loan of a million dollars,” Trump remarked. “I came into Manhattan, and I had to pay him back, and I had to pay him back with interest. But I came into Manhattan and I started buying properties, and I did great.” Yes, poor Trump spent his early years in expensive boarding schools and was given start-up money for his “business” career, the success of which has been questionable at best, given his multiple bankruptcies. It’s hard to imagine anyone more representative of the selfish excesses of wealthy America or be more disconnected from the struggles of everyday Americans. It’s mind-boggling to understand how anyone can pretend this man cares or even understands the problems facing the American middle class.  </mainText>
