    <mainText>Even though Donald Trump (sort of) dropped the âbirtherâ issue, thereâs one pro-Trump surrogate who â in the tightest re-election fight of his life â is still pledging to continue his investigation into President Obamaâs birth certificate. Sheriff Joe Arpaio, who was recently recommended for criminal court due to the continuation of racial profiling and perjury, told a group of Tea Party activists that he is certain Barack Obamaâs birth certificate is forged and will do everything he can to prove it: âIâm not going to give up, and weâre looking into it. I donât know how itâs going to turn out.Â I donât care where heâs from.Â We are looking at a forged document.Â Period.Â I had nothing to do with Trump on the birth certificate. We did it on our own, because of you guys.â The room of 200 or so activists were of course energized by Arpaioâs pledge to unleash the âtruth.â Before speaking to the crowd, Arpaio told reporters that it was the Tea Party activists in Maricopa County that got him âstuckâ with the birther issue after World Net Daily, a right-wing publication known for conspiracy theories, had a reporter speak to another group, and subsequently gathered almost 250 signatures demanding Arpaio investigate. He complied, launching his investigation last week. According to Arizona Central: Mike Zullo, the lead investigator on the case andÂ commander of Arpaioâs Cold Case Posse, told the crowd that he knew Trumpâs statement was a âpunch in the gut, because it was unexpected.âÂ Zullo said he thought Trumpâs statement was âstrategic.âÂ âItâs not going to deter us,â Zullo said. âItâs not going to stop us. I am closer than ever.â Zullo also claims that a nurse who worked at the hospital where President Obama was born, theÂ Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, denies that such a birth ever happened. Well there you have it. Not only are Maricopa County residents footing the bill for Arpaioâs legal woes (yet again), they are now paying for another âinvestigationâ into President Obamaâs birth certificate. Is this what Republicans mean by âfiscal responsibility?â In Maricopa County, there are almost 4.2 million taxpaying citizens. And now they are paying their Sheriffâs office their tax dollars to âinvestigateâ some fringe conspiracy supported by 250 activists. Think about that. Maybe thatâs why Arpaio is losing his re-election bid to a Democrat, Paul Penzone, and it might also explain why his poll numbers are plummeting. Good thing heâs focusing on the issues that matter. </mainText>
