    <mainText>Tragedy has left the Miami Marlins team in devastation. Their friend, colleague and someone they probably considered family, has died in a tragic accident. Such unexpected shocking loss is not an experience to wish on anyone.  Jose Fernandez, their pitcher, was killed in a boating accident Sunday morning. It was just last week he had posted a picture on social media of his girlfriend who had an obvious ‘baby bump’ in an announcement that they were expecting their first child. In its caption, he told the world he thanked his girlfriend for coming into his life and expressed his excitement for their future together as a family. A news conference was held by his team after learning of his death and the team’s manager, Don Mattingly, was very visibly shaken during the conference, in tears over the loss of his team player and friend. “I see such a little boy,” Mattingly said. “The way he played, there was just joy with him when he played.” When the news conference was over, left fielder, Christian Yellich and the team’s second baseman, Dee Gordon, embraced and walked out somberly with other team members. A loss like this, so unexpected… was visibly painful watching them trying to get a grip on the situation. Earlier, Gordon had walked out to the mound at Marlins Park, where the grounds crew had painted a “16” — Fernandez’s number — and placed a Marlins cap. Gordon stood looking at the tribute before kneeling down in a moment of silent reflection. “Sadly, the brightest lights are often the ones that extinguish the fastest,” Marlins owner Jeffrey Loria said in a statement.  We are stunned and devastated by the tragic news that Jose Fernandez, 24, has died in a boating accident. https://t.co/QIBcnIYJ1i pic.twitter.com/SDZoL6NMEb — MLB (@MLB) September 25, 2016    I will miss you… Sorry if i never told you how valuable your friendship was too me… pic.twitter.com/HzstRZDBri — Tom Koehler (@TKREFRESH22) September 25, 2016    You loved striking me out, and teasing me about it. I'm going to miss you bro #puiglovesyou pic.twitter.com/o3tqohRv5U — Yasiel Puig (@YasielPuig) September 25, 2016   Losing someone close to you is one of the hardest trials of life. He leaves behind an unborn baby, that will never get to meet him in the flesh, and that is heartbreaking in and of itself. Sending prayers of comfort to all those who are suffering from this loss. May he rest in peace. </mainText>
