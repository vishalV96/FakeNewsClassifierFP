    <mainText>Donald Trump Jr. has jammed his foot squarely in his mouth once again, with a particularly offensive tweet which compared Syrian refugees fleeing chlorine gas and napalm to “poisoned Skittles.” This image says it all. Let’s end the politically correct agenda that doesn’t put America first. #trump2016 pic.twitter.com/9fHwog7ssN — Donald Trump Jr. (@DonaldJTrumpJr) September 19, 2016  Let’s be very clear. The United States does not have a Syrian refugee problem. Our nation has accepted ten thousand refugees from Syria, a paltry number of the 4.6 milion Syrians that have been displaced by the horrifying violence of the Syrian Civil War. None of them have been connected to any domestic terrorist attacks in the United States, all of which have been committed by naturalized citizens, but the Donald Trump campaign continues to demonize these desperate people trying to escape the appalling bloodshed in their homeland. As NPR noted, “the odds of being killed by a refugee in a terrorist attack are about 1 in more than 3.6 billion, according to a recent Cato Institute study.” The company which makes Skittles, Wrigley’s, reached out to Hollywood reporter Seth Abramovitch with this epic response, which really says it all.  For the so-called party of “family values” to be fear-mongering over women and children running for their lives is the height of hypocrisy. We’d like to see a self-entitled dandy like Donald Trump Jr. walk a day in their shoes. Here’s the somber reality of the situation: @DonaldJTrumpJr This is the refugee crisis. Not skittles. This. #SkittlesWelcome @realDonaldTrump pic.twitter.com/IYPIUwTHdv — Sheila G. (@Sheila_Gotti) September 20, 2016 </mainText>
