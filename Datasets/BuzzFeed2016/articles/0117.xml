    <mainText>Youâve got to love Robert Reich. The former Secretary of Labor under future First Lady and former President Bill Clinton met a Trump supporter at a coffee shop and couldnât resist stopping for a moment to ruin the poor guyâs week by introducing him to a concept that is foreign to him: facts. âI finally found a Trump supporter â this morning when I went to buy coffee. (I noticed a Trump bumper sticker on his car.),â Reich writes in a Facebook post that has gone viral since he posted it Monday morning. Then he completely dismantled Trump â politely â before the guyâs very eyes: âHi,â I said. âNoticed your Trump bumper sticker.â âYup,â he said, a bit defensively. âI hope you donât mind my asking, but Iâm curious. Why are you supporting him?â âI know heâs a little bit much,â said the Trump supporter. âBut heâs a successful businessman. And we need a successful businessman as president.â âHow do you know heâs a successful businessman?â I asked. âBecause heâs made a fortune.â âHas he really?â I asked. âOf course. Forbes magazine says heâs worth four and a half billion.â âThat doesnât mean heâs been a success,â I said. âIn my book it does,â said the Trump supporter. âYou know, in 1976, when Trump was just starting his career, he said he was worth about $200 million,â I said. âMost of that was from his father.â âThat just proves my point,â said the Trump supporter. âHe turned that $200 million into four and a half billion. Brilliant man.â âBut if he had just put that $200 million into an index fund and reinvested the dividends, heâd be worth twelve billion today,â I said. The Trump supporter went silent. âAnd he got about $850 million in tax subsidies, just in New York alone,â I said. More silence. âHeâs not a businessman,âÂ Reich concluded. âHeâs a con man. âHope you enjoy your coffee.â While itâs unlikely that Reich managed to change the Trump fanâs mind â or even reach him on a level that matters â he surely left the guyÂ steaming more than a freshly-brewed cup of go-go- juice. Oh, to be a fly on the wall during that conversation! </mainText>
